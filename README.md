**Advice on taking R**

This past fall, I took a introduction to the coding language R. I was super excited and throughout the quarter learned many things. Although I learned a lot, the main things that guided me were Stack-overflow, R Studio's Console, debugging, and great videos on Youtube. 

StackOverflow #1 resource

StackOverflow is honestly everyone who codes best friend but with R is a useful resource and explains your error in detail. In addition, you’re able to better understand different aspects of R. An example being, I was confused with functions and how databases ran. Stacks-over flow had a whole thread on better understanding these two elements to my homework. I was able to understand it super quickly and not waste my time researching the web. 


Console saves lives

The console section in R studio truly helps students understand how their code, database and anything needing fact checking will look like before running all their code. The console is able to tell you future errors and if your database is empty or running efficiently. Another amazing thing that can be done on console, install packages,open libraries and R installed packages. 



Debugging

Debugging is super annoying but can help fix so many of the errors one will be running into. In addition, learning to debug saves students and their instructor time because they won’t fall into many issues during assignments. To master debugging, one needs to take the time to learn about their errors and not wait for their instructors to help to find their issues. Don’t feel bad for having errors. Just know the more errors, the more you’re growing. 



Youtube 

Finding motivation to understand and learn R is really hard. Especially if you’re an audio-based learner like myself. Some of the tools that have helped me have been reading online books and articles about different R syntaxes and tricks. In addition, youtube is your best friend. Youtube has many videos that guide you step by step to understand different elements of R. My favorite one has to be the video that guided me to create my final Leaflet map. 



In conclusion, be patient and be curious to learn about the language. Remember R is a language and cannot be learned really quickly. The first couple times solving problems will be heard but you will notice the growth. Good luck and always remember to be the best problem solver you can be. Lastly, don’t compare R to other languages you may know. It’s pretty similar to many languages but differs in many ways.
